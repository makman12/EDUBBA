# E.DUB.BA: School of Hittite Cuneiform #

This project aims to create an online tool for learning to read Hittite Cuneiform. 
The project consists of different lessons. Each lesson aims to teach 5 cuneiform signs.

The order in which the signs were taught was determined so that the most text could be read in the shortest time.
This ranking was reached by analyzing the Hittite corpus of 17 thousand words.
